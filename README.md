## Testing
The website looks good, all the links work and the sign up checks out. All different screen sizes work well with the website. Only a few bugs were found, mostly within the <img> attribute. which were solved by removing the space between the image. Both the W3C validator and the jigsaw validator returned no errors when analysing the scripts.

## Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
